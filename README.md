# 👋 Hey there!

Welcome to my digital space! 
I’m an undergrad BSc IT student with a keen interest in the financial markets, a growing fascination with blockchain, and a deepening desire for cloud computing. 
When I'm not deep in code or tech theory, you’ll probably find me thinking three to six moves ahead on a chessboard ♟️.

Currently polishing my JavaScript, Python, and React skills. I have plans to dive into PHP, C++, Java, and C# soon. You could say I'm building a full-stack mind 🧠

Fun fact? My family calls me *Professor* 😄. Maybe it's the obsession with learning… or maybe it's the unsolicited tech lectures at dinner 😅

Long-term, I’m working toward becoming an **AWS Solutions Architect**, blending my love for smart systems and scalable design in the cloud.

This repo is all about *me*, my learning journey, and the things I’m passionate about. Whether you're a fellow student, dev, recruiter, or just curious, I’m glad you stopped by.
Let’s connect, collaborate, or just geek out together 🤍
