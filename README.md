# 👋 Hey there!

Welcome to my digital space! I’m an undergrad BSc IT student with a sharp eye on the financial markets, a growing fascination with blockchain, and an ever-deepening love for cloud computing. When I'm not deep in code or tech theory, you’ll probably find me thinking three moves ahead on a chessboard ♟️.

I'm currently sharpening my skills in JavaScript, Python, and React — with plans to dive into PHP, C++, Java, and C# soon. You could say I'm building a full-stack mind 🧠✨

Fun fact? My family calls me *Professor* — maybe it's the obsession with learning… or maybe it's the unsolicited tech lectures at dinner 😅

Long-term, I’m working toward becoming an **AWS Solutions Architect**, blending my love for smart systems and scalable design in the cloud.

This repo is all about *me*, my learning journey, and the things I’m passionate about. Whether you're a fellow student, dev, recruiter, or just curious — I’m glad you stopped by. Let’s connect, collaborate, or just geek out together.
