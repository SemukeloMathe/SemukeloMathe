# 👋 Hey there!

Welcome to my digital space!

I’m on a mission to become a **Software Engineer**, building efficient, scalable, and innovative software that makes a difference. I’m currently pursuing a BSc IT degree while developing my skills in full-stack development and cloud technologies. When I'm not deep in code or tech theory, you’ll probably find me thinking five moves ahead on a chessboard ♟️

Currently polishing my JavaScript, Python, and React skills. I plan to dive into PHP, C++, Java, and C# soon. You could say I'm building a full-stack mind 🧠

Fun fact? My family calls me *Professor* 😄. Maybe it's the obsession with learning… or maybe it is the sleepless nights on my computer 👨🏽‍💻

Long-term, I’m working towards becoming an **AWS Solutions Architect**, blending my love for smart systems and scalable design in the cloud.

This repo is all about *me*, my learning journey, and the things I’m passionate about. Whether you're a fellow student, dev, recruiter, or just curious, I’m glad you stopped by.
Let’s connect, collaborate, play chess or just geek out together 🤍
